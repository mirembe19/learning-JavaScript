//the next examples are about arrays
//they are written in square brackets []
//the array items are separated by commas ,
//examples
const countries =["uganda" ,"kenya","rwanda"];

    //another example
    const numbers =[10,20,30,40];
    console.log(numbers)
    //numbers are not written in strings because i would change the whole statement
